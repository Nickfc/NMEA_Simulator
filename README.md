# HackRF GPS Route Generator - Dynamic Route Simulation for GPS Transmission

The HackRF GPS Route Generator project is aimed at simplifying the route generation for GPS signal simulations provided by `gps-sdr-sim`. It is a sophisticated tool that allows you to take real-world data, manipulate it as per your requirements, and create mock GPS scenarios.

## Powerful Features

### Route Generation: 
The tool allows you to generate realistic GPS routes for HackRF transmission. You can upload your route in a GPX file, customize settings as per your needs, and swiftly create a set of NMEA sentences which represent your GPS route. This file can then be directly fed into the `gps-sdr-sim` software to simulate the GPS signal.

### Authentic Simulation: 
The Physics Engine makes this tool stand-out by simulating real-world vehicle movement. It uses multiple factors to derive a realistic route pattern:

- **Vehicle Type**: Discrete movement profile patterns for various vehicle types, including but not limited to cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians.

- **Road Conditions**: The tool allows you to adjust the simulation based on road conditions- dry, wet, icy, or gravel.

- **Weather Conditions**: Influence of adverse weather conditions like rain, snow, or fog also accounted for in the simulations.

- **Driver Behavior**: User can also adjust for the driving behavior, i.e., aggressive, normal, or conservative.

This advanced simulation helps create natural and seamless GPS route patterns, making the route simulation as real as possible. 

### GPX Support: 
The tool uses GPX (GPS Exchange Format), an open-standard format that makes the utility highly flexible and functional with a host of other GPS tools. 

Route suggestions can be created at [OpenRouteService](https://maps.openrouteservice.org/#/place/@12.596511840820314,55.67574533639904,12) and then exported in "Standard GPX". 

### Altitude Support: 
The tool also includes altitude (elevation) data in its simulations, providing a holistic three-dimensional feel to the GPS route.

## Compatibility with HackRF and gps-sdr-sim
One of the noticeable features of this tool is its seamless compatibility with `gps-sdr-sim` and HackRF devices. 

The HackRF GPS Route Generator creates output files that are directly compatible with `gps-sdr-sim`. You can generate a GPS signal file that can then be transmitted using a HackRF device. This allows you to simulate the presence of a GPS device following your specified path effectively, making it an ideal tool for testing various GPS-based applications and services.

## Easy to Use:
With a simple and intuitive user interface, the HackRF GPS Route Generator ensures an easy and accessible experience for its users. You can adjust the settings, upload your GPX file, and generate the NMEA data all within a few clicks, requiring no specific technical knowledge.

## Credit and Acknowledgment:
This project is built upon and complements the functionalities of the `gps-sdr-sim` software for the creation of GPS signal files. The map route creation feature benefits from the reliable services provided by OpenRouteService. 

This blend of such powerful tools makes the HackRF GPS Route Generator a robust solution for those keen on exploring and innovating with GPS signals and trajectories.
